The hyoid bone, which is also known as the hyooid, is a a small U-shaped bone located in the anterior neck. In its resting position, it lies between the ase of the mandible and the third cervical vertebrae. We know that the second and the third pharyngeal arches give rise to the horns of the hyoid bone; therefore, the embryological origin of the hyoid bone are the second and the third pharyngeal arches\u2014this information is covered in option (G). Therefore, we conclude that (G) must be the correct answer. The answer is (G).",
