there were still many more that i felt might not necessarily belong in health

many of the unrelated and tangentially related questions should be moved to a different category like economics, chemistry, psychology, biology, history, philosophy, etc.


there were many that are on the borderline of health/biology/chemistry that I didn't include because I just wasn't sure.

it was hard to determine where exactly to draw the line, so if it ultimately related to human health i ignored it, but if it requires skills outside of health, i included it, e.g., stoichiometry-type questions or determining a point mutation in a DNA strand

anyway, there were so many to go through that i just quickly determined problem ids

the duplicates always came in pairs, so it might be a good idea to write a script to find them. just have it first check for sequential samples with the same question, and then put their answer choices into a set to confirm a match (because sometimes the answer choices might be expanded or slightly different).

I've identified a few questions that don't relate to health category they are assigned to. The problem items all come from the source "ori_mmlu-college_medicine"



Not related to health at all:
6717
6079
6205
6394
6645

Tangentially related to health:
6522
6139
6646
6647
6328

You can view all the problem rows using my HF dataset SQL query [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/TIGER-Lab/MMLU-Pro/sql-console/Qt_zTeD)



Here are a few of the duplicate mappings. I didn't want to do this for every example ðŸ˜…
